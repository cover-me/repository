# Description

A Python 2 script that monitors a, usually dilution, fridge's log file and triggers notifications or summaries when a user-defined status change occurs. Tested with Oxford Triton/DR series, PPMS, and CETC XS400 dilution fridges. 

The script automatically reads values from the most recent log file in a user-specified folder. Status-change events and the monitoring interval are configurable. Notifications can be sent via email or webhook (Slack, Feishu/Lark, WeChat Business/WeCom).

This script monitors log files generated by fridge control systems, therefore versatile. Alternative solutions include monitoring LabVIEW front panel controls (e.g., Leiden cryostat systems), see [FP_monitor.vi](https://github.com/cover-me/repository/tree/master/Leiden/1.0_190721_LV17).

# Installation

The script runs with Python 2. You can install python27 normally, or use a portable version of it (e.g., copy it from another computer into the script's folder as shown below).

Download the scripts to the fridge control computer. Configure paths in the BAT file and parameters (log folder/email/webhook URLs/event rules) in config.py. Double-click the BAT file (or the PY file directly if Python 2.7 is registered in your OS).

# Configure triggering events

To customize triggering events, modify the code below:

```python
# [0 val_low,1 val_high,2 msg_low,3 msg_high,4 status_init,5 delay_snapshot]
# 5 can be empty, it is used only if a msg containing "Snapshot" is added to the queue
rules = OrderedDict([
    ("Output Water Temp",[27,29,'PT water out<27','Alarm! PT water out>29',False]),
    ("Output Water Temp:2",[10,12,'Alarm! PT water out<10','',True]),
    ("Motor Current",[10,10.1,'Alarm! PT is off','PT is on',True]),
    ("MC RuO2 T(K)",[0.05,10,'MC < 0.05 K. Snapshot will be sent in 2 hours.','',True,3600*2]),
    ("Magnet T(K):1",[280,285,'','Magnet > 285 K. Snapshot will be sent in 2 hours.',True,3600*2]),
    ("Magnet T(K):2",[5,10,'Magnet < 5 K','',True]),
    ("Magnet T(K):3",[80,85,'Magnet < 80 K','Magnet > 85 K',True]),
    #("Dewar (mbar)",[5e-3,1,'OVC < 5e-3 mbar','OVC > 1 mbar',True]),
])
```

The original plan was to make the controlling computer beep when the "Alarm" appeared in the message. However, this function is not implemented, and it would be annoying (in the Leiden version I implemented the beeping). In the current version, "Alarm" is used only to make the font color of the title orange in the sent message.

If the "Snapshot" appears in the message, a snapshot of sensor data will be sent after the time_in_second specified at the end of the list. The sensors are specificated with the code

```python
snapshot_list = [i for i in labels if (i.endswith('T(K)')    
    and not i.startswith('chan'))
    or i in ['P1 Tank (Bar)','P3 Still (mbar)','Dewar (mbar)','Still heater (W)']
]
```

If a message is left empty, the corresponding event is disabled.

# Further reading

One can also get readings through TCP/IP but that may be occupied for experiments (and for DR200 TCP/IP does not return all values). For the TCP/IP method, see [DR and Triton qtlab drivers](https://github.com/cover-me/repository/tree/master/qt/qtlab%20new%20drivers), [Leiden TC_messenger](https://github.com/cover-me/repository/tree/master/Leiden/TC_messenger_2021_02_01), and [PPMS tcp-visa-server](https://github.com/cover-me/repository/tree/master/QD/tcp-visa-server).
